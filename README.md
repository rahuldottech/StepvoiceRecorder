# StepvoiceRecorder

------
### Rahul's Edit:
Check the [releases](https://github.com/rahuldottech/StepvoiceRecorder/releases) page for the original signed binary from stepvoice.com. `2.1.1.415` was the latest version ever released on the site. I'm not going to make any changes to the codebase, I really don't have the time to take on additional projects. This repo exists mostly for archival purposes, and to distribute the last verison ever released, which I was unable to find elsewhere on the internet. I definitely find this tool very handy.
